## ✨ What it does
This tool was built out of necessity: I needed a fast way to **bulk resize images into high-quality print sizes** for artwork.  
Instead of preparing each A1, A2, A3, A4 file manually, this app automatically generates:

- 📸 **JPG files** at 300 ppi for A1, A2, A3, and A4  
- 📄 **PDF files** at exact ISO paper dimensions (true A-series in millimetres)  
- 📦 A ready-to-download **ZIP archive** with everything included  
- ➕ Optional **1-inch margined versions** (extra white border for easy framing)

All the processing happens **in your browser**. No images are uploaded to a server.

## 🚀 How to use

2. **Upload your image**  
   - Drag & drop or click the drop zone.  
   - Use a high-resolution original for best results.

3. **Enter a base name**  
   - This name will be part of your exported files.  
   - Example: `Butterflies` → `A4_Butterflies_Print.jpg`.

4. **Set DPI** (default: 300)  
   - For print quality, keep **300 ppi**.  
   - You may lower it (e.g., 150) for lightweight web proofs.

5. (Optional) **Add margins**  
   - Adds 1-inch white borders around each size.  
   - Useful when selling printable wall art for framing.

6. Click **Generate Print Set ZIP**  
   - After processing, a **Download ZIP** button appears.  
   - Inside the ZIP you’ll find JPGs + PDFs for A1, A2, A3, A4.

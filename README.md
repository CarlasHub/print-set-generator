# Print Set Generator — Studio Edition

Live demo: `https://carlashub.github.io/print-set-generator/`

Turn a single high‑resolution image into a full print suite: A‑series, common ratios, inches/mm, optional margins, and PDFs — all in the browser.

## What’s new (power‑house upgrade)
- Pro layout with preview, output summary, and progress
- A1–A5 selection + extra size families (ratios, inches, mm, square)
- JPG/PDF toggles and quality slider
- Fit mode (contain or cover) and manual orientation
- Custom margin size + background color
- Fully client‑side and private

## How it works
1. Upload your master image
2. Choose sizes and formats
3. Generate and download a ZIP

All processing happens locally in the browser. No uploads.

## Tips for best results
- Use large originals (300 DPI for print)
- Use “Contain” to avoid cropping
- Use “Cover” when you want full‑bleed prints

## Roadmap
- Real‑time crop guides
- Multiple image batch mode
- Saved presets
